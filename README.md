# guess-a-word-CLI
A word guessing game made in node to practice object oriented programming.


This is a game made in Node, intended to showcase knowledge of Node, as well as the use of modules and constructors. This game is similar to another game that we made much earlier in class, but with only a basic knwoledge of HTML, CSS, and JS. My favorite part of this project was getting a chance to see how far we've come since the original word guess game.

My greatest challenge in making this game was getting all the modules to interact smoothly. Though rewarding once the modules that make up the program were working efficiently toegther, it took a couple adjusmtents to remove some sources of disjuncture. Overall, this prpoject was a fun application of new knowledge to an older concept.

The project is made entirely in Node, so it can't be deployed, but you can check out the code in this repository to get an idea for how it works.
